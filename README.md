# 🚘 Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) Web Application

## 📘 Introduction

The **Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS)** is a real-time web application developed to improve vehicle safety using state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system provides intelligent features such as object detection, lane tracking, distance estimation, night vision, voice alerts, and a GPS-like mini-map display — all within a user-friendly Streamlit interface.



## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect vehicles, pedestrians, and road objects using YOLOv8.  
- Track lane markings and estimate distances to nearby vehicles.  
- Provide real-time voice and visual alerts for potential collisions or lane deviations.  
- Maintain a secure, user-authenticated platform with history logging in MySQL.  
- Enhance situational awareness using night vision and a dynamic mini-map.

## 🔁 Workflow

### 🔹 User Authentication
- Registration and login system integrated with MySQL.
- Session control for secure user access.

### 🔹 Video Processing Pipeline
- Load live video or upload clips.
- Frame-by-frame processing in real-time.

### 🔹 Object Detection (YOLOv8)
- Detect cars, trucks, pedestrians, etc.
- Bounding boxes rendered on screen.
- Object detection logs saved to MySQL.

### 🔹 Lane Detection
- Grayscale conversion → Gaussian blur → Canny Edge Detection.
- ROI masking and Hough Line Transform for lane line fitting.

### 🔹 Distance Estimation
- Measure pixel distance from detected objects to the camera center.
- Trigger alerts if object distance < safety threshold.

### 🔹 Night Vision Mode
- Enhances low-light frames using histogram equalization.

### 🔹 Voice Alerts
- Real-time voice alerts for obstacles and deviations using `pyttsx3`.

### 🔹 Mini-Map Visualization
- Displays a 2D vehicle-relative layout.
- Icons for vehicle, detected objects, and lane markers.

## 📊 Result Interpretation

- All processed data (object type, distance, timestamp) stored in MySQL.
- Detection history can be viewed in tabular format.
- Alerts displayed on-screen with optional audio warnings.
- High accuracy and low latency under standard daylight driving conditions.

---

## ✅ Results

- **Object Detection Accuracy**: ~92% with YOLOv8.  
- **Lane Detection Accuracy**: ~90% under clear daylight conditions.  
- **Distance Estimation**: ±10% deviation on average.  
- **Voice Alerts**: Triggered within 0.5 seconds of hazard detection.

## 🔮 Future Work

- Integrate GPS for real-world location tracking.  
- Support for multi-camera inputs (e.g., front + rear).  
- Improve robustness in foggy/night conditions using thermal or infrared vision.  
- Add driver drowsiness detection and speed sign recognition.  
- Deploy as a mobile application or onboard system in vehicles.

## 🧾 Conclusion

This project presents a comprehensive real-time ADAS system implemented using modern computer vision, deep learning, and web technologies. The system demonstrates how affordable and accessible safety features can be integrated into modern vehicles using Python-based tools. The modular architecture ensures that each component — from lane tracking to object detection and user logging — contributes toward safer driving.
